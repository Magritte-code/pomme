    "## Observation\n",
    "In the previous section, we presented a theoretical model for spectral line formation.\n",
    "In practice, however, spectral line observations are affected by instrumentation effects, such as binning and noise, the particular form of which highly depends on the way the object is observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "High spatial and spectral resolution observations are typically obtained using interferometry, for which the situation is even more complicated, since there are spatial scale-dependent effects which cause the smallest and largest structures to be unresolved in the resulting images.\n",
    "These effects must carefully be taken into account, as they (in part) determine which information about the spatial distribution of the physical properties is encoded in the observations and which is not.\n",
    "At this point, we should clarify what we mean with interferometric data and distinguish between two types.\n",
    "The first type are the visibilities, i.e. the correlations between the coherent electromagnetic waves, measured in several frequency bins for the different pairs of antennas in the array.\n",
    "These visibilities are often further processed into images that map the actual brightness in the plane of the sky for each frequency bin.\n",
    "This is what we distinguish as the second type of interferometric data.\n",
    "The conversion of the sky brightness maps from the visibilities can be achieved, for instance, with the *clean* algorithm [(Hogbom 1974)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974A%26AS...15..417H/abstract), as implemented, for instance, in [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu).\n",
    "This conversion is in itself already an inverse problem.\n",
    "Therefore, when reconstructing a model from interferometric observations, it makes sense to start directly from the visibilities.\n",
    "However, since visibilities are more difficult to interpret than sky brightness maps, we consider both options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion of the observed intensity in the plane of the sky, $I_{\\text{obs}}(\\nu; x, y)$, to visibilities, $V(\\nu;u,v)$, can be expressed as,\n",

    "Since there are only a finite number of antennas and thus a finite number of antenna pairs, the visibilities are only known at a finite number of baseline samples, $\\{(u_{d},v_{d})\\}_{d=1}^{N_{d}}$.\n",
    "This sampling, which depends on the particular antenna configuration, causes a loss of information about the spatial distribution of the source in an intricate way.\n",
    "We can see that the transformation of the intensity in the plane of the sky into visibilities is essentially a 2D Fourier transform.\n",
    "Although the Fourier transform is invertible, the fact that we can only sample the visibilities for a finite number of baselines, makes that the combined transformation from a sky brightness map to a finite set of visibilities is not invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, we could use the exact pipeline to model the instrumentation effects in our forward model, for instance, using [CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu).\n",
    "However, later, in our reconstruction algorithm,\n",
    "we want the implementation of the forward function, $f$, to be automatically differentiable using the *autograd* functionality in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).\n",
