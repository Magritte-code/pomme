Background
##########

Here we provide some background on the physics of spectral line observations, the Bayesian reconstruction algorithm, and their numerical implementation in pomme.
All of this is based on our paper `De Ceuster et. al (2024) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240218525D/abstract>`_.
Please cite the paper if you use any of this information.
